Basketball Olympics Simulation

This repository contains a simulation system for a basketball Olympics tournament. It calculates team performance, including match outcomes, score generation, and updates to team form factors based on wins and losses. The simulation adjusts each team's formFactor to reflect their current standing and performance, which influences future match results.

Commands:

`npm run dev`: Starts the development server with TypeScript for live development.

`npm run start`: Runs the production build using JavaScript.

`npm run watch`: Monitors TypeScript files for changes and automatically rebuilds without restarting the server.
